__Floppy Bird__ is a port of Flappy Bird that runs in BIOS, written in x86 assembly (nasm syntax).

To play, just flush the image to your pendriave, CD or ~flappy~ floppy disk and boot your computer from it. Alternatively, you may use virtual machine or emulator, for example Virtual Box (note that VB has probably something messed up with clock, so you may need to adjust timing in code).
