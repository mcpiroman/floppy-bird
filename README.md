__Floppy Bird__ is a port of Flappy Bird that runs in BIOS and is written in x86 assembly (nasm syntax).

To play, just [download](https://github.com/mcpiroman/floppy-bird/releases) and flush the image to your pendriave, CD or ~flappy~ floppy disk and boot your computer from it. Alternatively, you may use virtual machine or emulator, for example Virtual Box (note that seemingly VB has something messed up with clock, so you may need to adjust timing in code).

To compile from code, install [nasm](https://www.nasm.us/) and run `build` script.
